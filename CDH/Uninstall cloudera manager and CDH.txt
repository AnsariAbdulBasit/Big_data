1) Stop all Cluster services from Cloudera Manager Admin Web page.

2) Stop all Cloudera Management Services.

3) Remove downloaded parcels which were used for installlation purpose. On Cloudera Manager Admin console, click on Parcel indicator icon in the top navigation bar. 
For each installed parcel, deactive the parcel followed by removing it.

4) Uninstall Cloudera Manager Server. Since I installed cloudera manager server using using cloudera-manager-installer.bin, I had to use the following command:
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/cmf/uninstall-cloudera-manager.sh


All the steps below MUST be executed on each node in the cluster.
1) Stop Cloudera Manager Agent using the following command:
sudo service cloudera-scm-agent hard_stop

2) Uninstall software by executing the follwoing command:
sudo apt-get remove ‘cloudera-manager-*’
sudo apt-get clean all

Remove data files and Cloudera Manager from each node in cluster.
1) Remove cloudera Manager data. When you install Cloudera Manager, it creates a partition on each agent host and mounts it as cm_processes. You will have to un mount cm_processes using the following command:
sudo umount cm_processes

2) Remove Cloudera Manager data by running the following command:
sudo rm -Rf /usr/share/cmf /var/lib/cloudera* /var/cache/yum/cloudera* /var/log/cloudera* /var/run/cloudera*

Please note that if you do not unmount cm_processes as described in Step 1, you will get error meaasge ‘rm: cannot remove `/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process’: Device or resource busy’

3) Remove CDH data by executing following commands:
sudo rm -Rf /dfs /mapred /yarn (please change these paths based on how you setup your cluster)
sudo rm -Rf /var/lib/flume-ng /var/lib/hadoop* /var/lib/hue /var/lib/oozie /var/lib/solr /var/lib/sqoop*

4) Kill the following Cloudera/Hadoop eco-system processes (if running ) on each node:
hdfs
mapred
cloudera-scm
hbase
hue
zookeeper
oozie
hive
impala
flume


5) Remove any remaining Cloudera specific files by executing the following command:
sudo rm -Rf /opt/cloudera /etc/hadoop /etc/cloudera-scm-agent /etc/hive /var/run/hdfs-* /var/lib/hive /var/lib/alternatives/hive-conf /etc/alternatives/hive-conf /var/run/hbase /var/log/impalad /var/run/impala /var/lib/impala /var/run/sqoop2 /var/run/solr /var/run/zookeeper /var/run/hadoop-httpfs /var/lib/alternatives/hadoop-conf /etc/alternatives/hadoop-conf

6) Remove Cloudera Manager lock file by executing the following command:
sudo rm /tmp/.scm_prepare_node.lock

7) Stop and remove any external databases that you might have setup for Hive metastore, Oozie.

find / -name cloudera*

remove all the path where cloudera is installed

Remove all packages
